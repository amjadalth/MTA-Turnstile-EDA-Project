## MTA Project Proposal 
**Overview** <br/><br/>
In this project, I will try to find the crowd times of people who use the MTA service in the days before Independence Day, to set up a movable booth to sell things related to the activities of this day in the crowded times. I will study the data for 3 weeks of (June- July) from (2016-2019). <br/><br/>

**Goal** <br/><br/>
Find the crowd times of people who use the MTA service in the days before and after Independence Day. <br/><br/>
**Questions** <br/><br/>
-What are the crowded times in MTA for the selected periods? <br/>
-Is there a difference in the crowded times for weekends or weekdays? <br/>
-Which station was the most crowded? <br/><br/>

**Dataset** <br/><br/>

The data is about Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Turnstile, and I obtained the data from http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html. At the beginning, clean the data that tend to be noisy, incomplete, and inconsistent. Then, add the columns that I need when studying the data, after that, d the required analysis until get the expected results.

The data I have selected are 3 weeks for each year starting from 18 June 2016 until 6 July 2019 to get more accurate results. And I have avoided using the year 2020 because it is a special year due to covid19 and the results may not be accurate in this year. <br/><br/>

**Tools** <br/><br/>
Technologies: Python, Jupyter notebook, SQL.
Libraries: Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

Conclusion
In conclusion, what I expected from studying this data is that the crowded times in the weekends in the days before and after Independence Day are more than weekdays, and also in weekdays
